## Things to do for the Mentor App


**PER MESSAGE PROCESSING:**
- Per Message of Student -> AI Response (Human In the Loop) can edit and send
- Per Message -> Add to KB
- Per Message -> Define followup (suggested by AI, can be edited)


**SMART FOLLOWUPS:**
- Ping mentees with low attendance
- How many leaves taken per student



**OTHER FUNCTIONS**
- Scheduling meets with mentees on the click of a button based on KB when things are going back



**BETTER UI THINGS:**
- Dashboard of all the mentees -> Attendance, CGPA [already there]
- Improve UI of the main dashboard to draw attention to the main tasks that the mentor has to do (based on new messages)
